#ShoppingList-App

This was my first project using Django Framework a simple shoping list.

The project has one app where I integrated the functionality of viewing the list of products, adding products, deleting them from the list, and change the status of the product from buyed to not buyed. 

Database
----------
For the database of this project, I used DB SQLite3 for storing all my data of the shopping list.

Front end
-----------
For the front end of the store, I used Django templates where I stored the HTML, Django template tags, and language aslo I used Bootstrap.
